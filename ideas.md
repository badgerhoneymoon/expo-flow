Interested in single charging station for their parking lot. Limited budget, looking for basic solution. Want to test EV charging as an amenity.

I just had a great conversation with Michael Smith, the Director of Infrastructure at the 
NSW Energy Office. He expressed strong interest in our sustainability focused EV charging 
solutions, particularly in light of the Minns government's recent initiative to roll out 
671 public kerbside EV chargers across the state. Michael sees our solution as potentially 
valuable for this large-scale deployment, especially in Sydney's eastern suburbs and 
Newcastle. He mentioned that I should connect with Jane Doe, the sustainability manager, 
once she returns from her maternity leave. We should plan to reach out to her around 
December 20th to explore potential collaboration opportunities.
